As promised to a tenacious viewer, here's the Unity project for my weekly stream. It's meant as a sample for how to tackle various issues that might arise if you want to make a custom interactive stream overlay. Some of the stuff it does:
* Renders for full-alpha transparency in OBS (use "Game Capture" in OBS and check the transparency box)
* Takes viewer submissions via a bot
* Handles follow, subscription, and cheer events
* Handles channel point reward events to in-game effect

I'll probably be adding new features for a while to come. There's plenty of janky stuff going on, so imitate at your own peril... but I do suggest you tune and watch! It's every Tuesday from 8 PM to 11 PM Eastern.
